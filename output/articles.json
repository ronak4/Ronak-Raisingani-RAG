    "article_content": "**Energy Bill H.R. 1: A Comprehensive Plan to Lower Costs and Boost Development**\n\nIn the ongoing debate over energy policy, Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) has introduced [H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1), a sweeping piece of legislation aimed at reducing energy costs and accelerating the development of domestic resources. The bill, which was introduced on March 14, 2023, has already made significant progress through the legislative process.\n\n### What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?\n\nH.R. 1 seeks to expedite the exploration, development, importation, and exportation of energy resources such as oil, gas, and minerals. Key provisions include expediting energy projects, eliminating or reducing certain fees related to federal energy resource development, and ending funds that incentivize reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The bill is currently under consideration by multiple committees.\n\n### What Committees Is This Bill In?\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act has been referred to several key committees for review:\n- [Natural Resources Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/natural-resources-committee)\n- [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/energy-and-commerce-committee)\n- [Transportation and Infrastructure Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/transportation-and-infrastructure-committee)\n\nThese committees will likely hold hearings, consider amendments, and ultimately vote on the bill before it can move forward.\n\n### Who Is the Sponsor?\n\nRep. Steve Scalise from Louisiana's 1st congressional district is the sponsor of H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act. As a Republican, Scalise has long advocated for energy independence and lower costs for consumers. His introduction of this bill reflects his commitment to these goals.\n\n### Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any of the Cosponsors on the Committee That the Bill Is in?\n\nH.R. 1 has garnered support from a diverse group of cosponsors, including:\n- Rep. McMorris Rodgers, Cathy [R-WA-5] (R-WA)\n- Rep. Westerman, Bruce [R-AR-4] (R-AR)\n- Rep. Graves, Sam [R-MO-6] (R-MO)\n\nInterestingly, some of these cosponsors are also members of the committees considering H.R. 1:\n- Rep. McMorris Rodgers is a member of both the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n- Rep. Westerman serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n- Rep. Graves is part of the Natural Resources Committee.\n\n### Have Any Hearings Happened on the Bill? If So, What Were the Findings?\n\nWhile no specific hearings have been held directly on H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act as of now, several relevant hearings have taken place in committees associated with the bill:\n- [AMERICAN NUCLEAR ENERGY EXPANSION: UPDATING POLICIES TO ENHANCE THE ROLE OF NUCLEAR POWER IN A CARBON-FREE FUTURE](https://www.congress.gov)\n- [MACRA CHECKUP: ASSESSING IMPLEMENTATION AND CHALLENGES](https://www.congress.gov)\n\nThese hearings have provided valuable insights into the broader energy landscape and may inform future discussions on H.R. 1.\n\n### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed on the Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?\n\nSeveral amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act:\n- **Amendment 168** (Sponsor: Rep. Graves [R-LA]) aims to provide regulatory certainty by explicitly authorizing common practices like NPDES general permits and allowing continuances during administrative delays.\n- **Amendment 167** requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue regulations for carbon capture, utilization, and storage technologies.\n\nThese amendments reflect ongoing efforts to refine and strengthen the bill's provisions.\n\n### Have Any Votes Happened on the Bill? If So, Was It a Party-Line Vote or a Bipartisan One?\n\nYes, votes have occurred on H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act:\n- **Passed \u2014 On passage**: The bill passed by a vote of 225 to 204 (Roll no. 182). This indicates that the vote was not strictly party-line; there were some Democrats who voted in favor and some Republicans who voted against.\n\nThis bipartisan support suggests that H.R. 1 may have broader appeal, but it remains to be seen how the bill will fare as it moves through further committee stages.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act (H.R. 1) represents a significant step forward in energy policy reform. With its wide-ranging provisions and strong bipartisan support, this bill could potentially reshape the domestic energy landscape. However, its ultimate fate remains uncertain as it continues to navigate the complex legislative process.\n\nFor those concerned about energy costs and environmental regulations, H.R. 1 is an important piece of legislation worth following closely. The bill's passage through committees and the subsequent votes indicate a growing consensus on the need for reform, but the road ahead will be challenging. Stay tuned as this bill continues to evolve in Congress."

As the bill makes its way through Congress, it is currently under review by two key committees: the [Ways and Means Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/hswm00) and the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/hsif00).\n\n**What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?**\nThe Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 seeks to improve transportation infrastructure, promote alternative fuel vehicles, and enhance public transit options. While the bill is still in its early stages, it has not yet undergone any committee action or received a vote. As of now, no specific details on the content of the legislation are publicly available.\n\n**What Committees Is This Bill In?**\nThe [Ways and Means Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/hswm00) is responsible for tax policy and revenue generation, while the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/hsif00) oversees issues related to energy, health care, and telecommunications. Both committees are crucial in shaping the bill's fate.\n\n**Who Is the Sponsor?**\nThe bill was introduced by Representative John Joyce (R-PA), a member of the Republican Party who represents Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th congressional district. Joyce has been vocal about transportation issues and is known for his work on infrastructure bills.

If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?**\nNo amendments have been proposed for H.R. 5371 as of the latest update. This means that the bill remains in its original form without any modifications from other members of Congress.\n\n**Have Any Votes Happened on the Bill? If So, Was It a Party-Line Vote or a Bipartisan One?**\nNo votes have been recorded for H.R. 5371 as it has not yet reached the floor for debate and voting. The lack of action so far suggests that the bill is still in the early stages of its legislative journey.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023, introduced by Representative John Joyce, aims to enhance transportation infrastructure and promote alternative fuels. While it has not yet undergone any committee hearings or received a vote, the support from multiple cosponsors and its referral to key committees suggest that it could play a significant role in shaping future mobility policies. For now, stakeholders will be watching closely as the bill progresses through Congress.\n\nAs this bill moves forward, it is important for constituents to stay informed about its developments. Whether you are concerned about transportation infrastructure or energy policy, following the progress of H.R. 5371 could have implications for your community and beyond."

This bill seeks to address concerns that changes made by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on May 1, 2023, have increased costs for middle-class borrowers seeking conventional single-family mortgages.\n\n### What Does the Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 aims to reverse the fee adjustments introduced by FHFA. Specifically, it reinstates the previous fee structure that was in place before May 1, 2023. These changes revised the fee charts based on a mortgagor's credit score and down payment, leading to higher costs for many borrowers.\n\nCurrently, the bill is still pending and has not yet moved beyond its initial referral. It remains at the [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/banking-housing-and-urban-affairs), where it will need further action before moving to a full vote in the Senate.\n\n### What Committees Is This Bill In?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 is currently under consideration by the [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/banking-housing-and-urban-affairs). This committee plays a crucial role in shaping financial regulations that affect millions of American homeowners.\n\n### Who Is the Sponsor?\n\nThe bill was introduced by Senator Mike Braun from Indiana ([R-IN]). As a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Senator Braun has been vocal about his concerns regarding the impact of FHFA's fee changes on middle-class families.

Are Any of the Cosponsors on the Committee That the Bill Is in?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 has garnered support from a total of 15 cosponsors. Among them, several key members of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee have signed on:\n\n- **Sen. Marshall, Roger [R-KS] (R-KS)**\n- **Sen. Tillis, Thomas [R-NC] (R-NC)**\n\nThese cosponsors bring significant influence to the bill's passage through the committee process.\n\n### Have Any Hearings Happened on the Bill? If So, What Were the Findings?\n\nWhile no specific hearings have been held for the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023, two related hearings have taken place. The first was titled \"BANNING NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS: BENEFITS FOR WORKERS, BUSINESSES, AND THE ECONOMY,\" which focused on labor market issues but may provide context for understanding broader economic impacts. The second hearing, \"THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL TAX REFORM,\" discussed tax policy and its effects on the economy, which could indirectly relate to housing finance.\n\n### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed on the Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023. However, if any are introduced, they will be available through [Amendments](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2296/amendments).\n\n### Have Any Votes Happened on the Bill?

This bill aims to provide much-needed support for local and tribal governments by awarding grants that will help them plan and implement programs aimed at addressing homelessness.\n\nThe legislation requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to allocate funds to these entities, enabling them to carry out a variety of activities related to housing and services for homeless individuals and families. A key feature is the provision of five-year implementation grants, which will assist in covering both capital building costs and ongoing operational expenses.\n\n### What Does This Bill Do?

With its focus on providing comprehensive support to local and tribal governments, the bill has the potential to make a substantial impact. However, without any hearings or votes so far, it remains uncertain how this legislation will progress.\n\nFor those concerned about homelessness, the status of S.24 is closely tied to the actions of the HELP Committee. As the bill moves forward, stakeholders and advocates will be watching closely to see if it gains momentum and ultimately becomes law.\n\nStay tuned for updates as the legislative process unfolds."

    "article_content": "**Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer Proposes New Tax on Electric Vehicles to Fund Highway Trust Fund**\n\nIn an effort to address the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and fund critical infrastructure projects, Nebraska Republican Senator Deb Fischer has introduced a new bill aimed at imposing additional taxes on EV sales. The **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882) would impose a $1,000 excise tax on the sale of an electric vehicle and a $550 excise tax on battery modules weighing over 1,000 pounds. The collected funds would be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nThe bill defines an electric vehicle as a light-duty motor vehicle with a gross weight less than 8,500 pounds that is primarily powered by electricity. This includes both plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. By targeting these specific types of vehicles, Senator Fischer hopes to ensure that those who benefit from the infrastructure improvements pay their fair share.\n\nThe **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882) is currently referred to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration. This committee has a crucial role in shaping tax legislation, making it the first stop for this bill.\n\nSenator Fischer [F000463](https://www.congress.gov/member/F000463), who sponsored the bill, represents Nebraska\u2019s second congressional district and is known for her focus on infrastructure and transportation issues. The senator has been vocal about the need to fund highway projects and ensure that all users of these roads contribute fairly.\n\nThe bill currently has three cosponsors: Senator Pete Ricketts [R-NE], Senator John Cornyn [R-TX], and Senator Cynthia M. Lummis [R-WY]. Notably, two of the cosponsors\u2014Senators Ricketts and Lummis\u2014are also members of the Senate Finance Committee. This alignment could expedite the bill\u2019s progress through committee.\n\nSo far, there have been no hearings held on the **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882). The first hearing related to this issue was titled \"HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUPPLEMENTAL IRS FUNDING CUTS: ANALYZING THE IMPACT ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FED\" [https://www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov), which took place on May 16, 2023. However, this hearing was not specifically focused on the EV tax bill.\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for the **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882). The bill is currently in its early stages and has not yet faced any votes.\n\nThe introduction of this bill reflects a broader debate about how to fund infrastructure projects as the transportation landscape evolves. With more Americans choosing electric vehicles, Senator Fischer\u2019s proposal aims to ensure that these users contribute financially to maintaining roads and highways. However, critics argue that such taxes could discourage EV adoption, which is critical for reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAs the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be interesting to see how stakeholders respond. The Senate Finance Committee will play a pivotal role in shaping the final version of the legislation. If passed, this bill could set a precedent for future transportation funding measures.\n\nFor now, supporters and opponents are closely watching the progress of S.2882. Whether it becomes law or not, the debate surrounding electric vehicle taxes is likely to continue as lawmakers grapple with balancing environmental goals with fiscal realities."

This program provides crucial funding for state and local governments to improve and expand the collection and analysis of DNA evidence, particularly in sexual assault cases.\n\nThe bill is currently under review by the [Judiciary Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/ssju00), which has a key role in shaping legislation related to criminal justice. The Judiciary Committee's oversight ensures that any proposed changes align with broader legal and policy goals.\n\nSenator Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, introduced this bill as part of his commitment to enhancing public safety measures. With 16 cosponsors, the bipartisan support for S.499 is evident. Cosponsors include notable figures such as Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Notably, all these senators are members of the Judiciary Committee, which suggests a high likelihood that they will closely monitor the bill's progress.\n\nWhile the bill is in its early stages, no specific hearings have been held to date. The closest related hearing was on \"Oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons\" ([Hearing](https://www.congress.gov)), but it did not address S.499 directly. This lack of direct scrutiny might raise concerns about the bill's potential impact and effectiveness.\n\nHowever, a proposed amendment titled [Amendment 1361](https://www.congress.gov/amendment/118th-congress/senate-bill/499/amendment/1361) has been introduced. This amendment seeks to enhance the bill by adding specific provisions aimed at improving the collection and analysis of DNA evidence. While no sponsor is listed for this amendment, its inclusion signals ongoing efforts to refine and strengthen the legislation.\n\nAs of now, there have been no votes on S.499. Given that it is a reauthorization bill, it may face less opposition compared to new legislation. However, without any recorded votes, it's difficult to determine whether it will be passed as a party-line vote or with bipartisan support.\n\nThe Debbie Smith Act of 2023 ([S.499](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/499)) represents an important step in addressing the backlog of untested sexual assault kits across the country. By providing critical funding, this bill aims to ensure that more cases can be solved and justice served. As it moves through the Judiciary Committee, stakeholders will closely watch its progress.\n\nFor now, supporters hope that S.499 will gain momentum and eventually become law. The bill's reauthorization could significantly impact how DNA evidence is handled in sexual assault cases, potentially leading to faster resolutions and more convictions. However, without further hearings or votes, the future of this legislation remains uncertain.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Debbie Smith Act of 2023 has strong backing from key senators, its journey through Congress will be crucial for its success. As it continues to move forward, all eyes are on how it will fare in committee and beyond."

Sanders, Bernard [I-VT]](https://www.congress.gov/member/S000033)), aims to bolster workers' rights and ensure fair negotiations.\n\nThe resolution, currently in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, expresses support for UAW members as they seek better working conditions and wages. It calls on the automakers to negotiate in good faith and offers a fair contract to their employees. This move comes at a critical time when workers are facing significant challenges due to ongoing negotiations.\n\nThe bill has garnered 33 cosponsors from both parties, including Senators Brown, Baldwin, Warren, and Fetterman. Notably, all of these cosponsors are members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, ensuring that the resolution will receive thorough consideration within the committee.\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held on S.Res.412. The bill was introduced to support UAW members but has not yet reached a stage where it can be discussed in detail by lawmakers. For the most up-to-date information, you can visit the official [Congress.gov page for S.Res.412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/412).\n\nNo amendments have been proposed for this bill as of now. The resolution stands on its own, with no changes or additions suggested by other lawmakers. This means that the current wording and intent of the bill remain intact.\n\nSince there are no recorded roll call votes, it is not possible to determine if any vote was a party-line vote or bipartisan one at this time. However, given Senator Sanders' history of supporting workers\u2019 rights and his cosponsors from both parties, it's likely that the resolution will receive broad support when it does come up for consideration.\n\nThe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee plays a crucial role in shaping labor laws and policies. By being referred to this committee, S.Res.412 is taking an important step towards becoming law. The committee has the power to hold hearings, make recommendations, and ultimately decide whether or not the resolution should move forward.\n\nIn conclusion, while S.Res.412 remains in early stages of the legislative process, it represents a significant show of support for UAW members during critical negotiations with major automakers. With bipartisan backing and no amendments proposed so far, the bill is well-positioned to gain momentum as it moves through Congress. For those concerned about workers' rights and fair labor practices, this resolution offers hope that progress can be made in improving conditions for millions of American workers.\n\nStay tuned for updates on the status of S.Res.412 as it progresses through the legislative process.

[Rep. Dan Newhouse](https://www.congress.gov/member/N000189), a Republican representative from Washington\u2019s 4th district, introduced H.Res.353 to ensure that this issue receives the attention it deserves.\n\nThe bill is currently referred to two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Judiciary Committee. [Natural Resources Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/natural-resources-committee/house) focuses on issues related to natural resources, public lands, and water, while the Judiciary Committee handles matters of justice, civil rights, and legal reform.\n\nAs of now, 39 cosponsors have joined Newhouse in supporting this resolution. Among them are representatives such as Gwen Moore (D-WI-4), Doris O. Matsui (D-CA-7), Katie Porter (D-CA-47), and Eleanor Holmes Norton (Del.), a long-time advocate for indigenous rights. Notably, several of these cosponsors also sit on the Natural Resources Committee, which could expedite the bill\u2019s progress.\n\nNo specific hearings have been held on H.Res.353 as of now. However, it is worth noting that related bills and topics have had hearings in Congress. For instance, [H.R. 6441](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6441), which addresses violence against women, has undergone scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee.\n\nSince H.Res.353 is a resolution and not a bill that proposes new laws or funding, no amendments have been proposed for this particular resolution. The focus remains on raising awareness rather than implementing specific policies.\n\nAs of now, there are no recorded votes on H.Res.353. Given the bipartisan nature of its sponsors and cosponsors, it is likely that any vote would be a bipartisan effort. However, without a recorded vote, we cannot determine if this will be the case.\n\nThe introduction of H.Res.353 by Rep. Newhouse marks an important step in addressing the urgent need to recognize and honor the lives lost to violence while also advocating for better support systems for indigenous communities. The resolution aims to create a day dedicated to remembering those who have gone missing or been murdered, as well as to push for more comprehensive data collection and policy changes.\n\nWhile H.Res.353 is currently in the early stages of the legislative process, its potential impact on raising awareness and fostering dialogue around this critical issue cannot be understated. As it moves through the committees and potentially receives a vote, it will be crucial to monitor its progress and support from both sides of the aisle.\n\nIn conclusion, H.Res.353 is an important step towards recognizing the ongoing struggle faced by indigenous women and girls. While there are no immediate concerns about the bill\u2019s passage, continued attention and support are necessary to ensure that this issue receives the national recognition it deserves."
