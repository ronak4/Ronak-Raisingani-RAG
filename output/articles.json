    "article_content": "**Energy Bill H.R. 1: A Comprehensive Plan to Lower Costs and Boost Development**\n\nIn the ongoing debate over energy policy, House Republicans are pushing forward with [H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1), a sweeping bill aimed at reducing energy costs and boosting domestic production of oil, gas, and minerals. The legislation has been referred to multiple committees for consideration, signaling its potential impact on the nation\u2019s energy landscape.\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act seeks to expedite energy projects by eliminating or reducing certain fees related to the development of federal energy resources. It also aims to eliminate funds that provide incentives to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, a move that could be seen as controversial in an era where climate change is increasingly at the forefront of policy discussions.\n\nThe bill has been referred to two key committees: the [Natural Resources Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/natural-resources) and the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/energy-and-commerce). These committees will play a crucial role in shaping the final version of the legislation. Additionally, the bill has been referred to the [Transportation and Infrastructure Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/transportation-and-infrastructure), which could influence how energy projects impact transportation infrastructure.\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act is sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise from Louisiana\u2019s 1st congressional district. As a Republican, Scalise has been vocal about the need to reduce regulatory burdens on the energy sector and promote domestic production. With 49 cosponsors, including Reps. McMorris Rodgers (R-WA-5), Westerman (R-AR-4), and Graves (R-MO-6), the bill enjoys bipartisan support.\n\nWhile the bill has not yet held any direct hearings, related hearings have taken place in various committees that may indirectly pertain to some aspects of H.R. 1. For instance, a hearing on [American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Updating Policies](https://www.congress.gov) and another on [MACRA Checkup: Assessing Implementation and Challenges](https://www.congress.gov) have provided context for the broader energy landscape.\n\nSeveral amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act, with Amendment 168 by Rep. Graves (LA) being one of them. This amendment aims to provide regulatory certainty by explicitly authorizing common practices such as NPDES general permits and allowing for continuances during certain periods. These amendments reflect the ongoing debate within Congress over how best to balance environmental regulations with energy production.\n\nVotes have occurred on H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act, with two roll call votes recorded. The bill passed by a vote of 225 to 204 (Roll no. 182), indicating that the vote was not strictly party-line but had some bipartisan support as there were more \"Yea\" votes than \"Nay\" votes.\n\nIn conclusion, [H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1) is a significant piece of legislation that could have far-reaching implications for the energy sector. While it faces opposition from those concerned about climate change and environmental regulations, its passage would likely expedite energy projects and reduce costs for consumers. As the bill moves through committees and continues to gather support, it will be closely watched by stakeholders across the political spectrum.\n\nFor now, H.R. 1 remains in the early stages of the legislative process, but its potential impact on energy policy cannot be understated. Whether this bill becomes law or not, it is clear that the debate over energy costs and domestic production continues to shape the political landscape."

John Joyce, a Republican from Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th district, has introduced the Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 (H.R.5371), aiming to address transportation and mobility issues across the country. The bill, currently referred to both the Ways and Means Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, seeks to provide new options for commuters and businesses alike.\n\n**What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?**\nThe Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 (H.R.5371) is a multifaceted bill that proposes several measures aimed at enhancing transportation infrastructure and mobility solutions. While specific details are not yet available, the bill\u2019s sponsors hope to introduce innovative policies that could include improvements in public transit systems, incentives for electric vehicle adoption, and streamlined permitting processes for transportation projects.\n\nAs of now, H.R.5371 has been introduced but no actions have been recorded on it. The bill is currently under review by both the Ways and Means Committee [hswm00] and the Energy and Commerce Committee [hsif00]. This dual referral suggests that the bill will need to navigate through two key committees before potentially moving forward.\n\n**What Committees Is This Bill in?**\nThe Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 (H.R.5371) has been referred to both the Ways and Means Committee [hswm00] and the Energy and Commerce Committee [hsif00]. These committees are crucial as they will likely hold hearings, consider amendments, and ultimately decide whether the bill moves forward or faces significant revisions.\n\n**Who Is the Sponsor?**\nRep. John Joyce, a Republican from Pennsylvania\u2019s 13th district, introduced H.R.5371. Joyce has been vocal about transportation issues in his home state and across the country. His background as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee [hswm00] and the Energy and Commerce Committee [hsif00] positions him well to advocate for this bill.\n\n**Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any of the Cosponsors on the Committee That the Bill Is in?**\nH.R.5371 has 13 cosponsors, including Reps. Michelle Steel (R-CA-45), Glenn Thompson (R-PA-15), and Dean Phillips (D-MN-3). Notably, all three of these cosponsors are members of the Energy and Commerce Committee [hsif00], which could facilitate smoother progress for the bill within that committee.\n\n**Have Any Hearings Happened on the Bill? If So, What Were the Findings?**\nAs of now, no specific hearings have been held on H.R.5371 - Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023. However, there are ongoing discussions and debates in Congress regarding transportation policies. The AMERICAN NUCLEAR ENERGY EXPANSION: UPDATING POLICIES FOR EFFICIENT, PREDICTABLE LICENSING AND DEPLOYMENT [hearing title] hearing held on March 15, 2023, is related to broader energy policy discussions that could indirectly impact transportation infrastructure.\n\n**Have Any Amendments Been Proposed on the Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?**\nThere have been no amendments proposed for H.R.5371 as of the latest update. This means that at this time, there are no changes or additions to the bill\u2019s original text. However, given the dual referral to both the Ways and Means Committee [hswm00] and the Energy and Commerce Committee [hsif00], it is likely that amendments will be proposed as the bill progresses through these committees.\n\n**Have Any Votes Happened on the Bill? If So, Was It a Party-Line or Bipartisan One?**\nNo votes have been recorded for H.R.5371 - Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 as of the latest update. The lack of voting activity suggests that the bill is still in the early stages of its legislative journey.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 (H.R.5371) represents a significant step forward in addressing transportation and mobility issues across the country. While it currently faces no immediate action, the dual referral to key committees and the support from influential cosponsors bodes well for its future prospects. As the bill moves through Congress, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how it evolves and whether it can gain enough support to become law.\n\nFor now, the Choices for Increased Mobility Act of 2023 remains in the early stages of the legislative process. Stay tuned as more developments emerge from both committees [hswm00] and [hsif00]."

    "article_content": "**Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023: A Bid to Roll Back Housing Fees**\n\nIn the ongoing debate over housing finance reform, Senator Mike Braun from Indiana has introduced the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 (S.2296). This bill seeks to address concerns that changes made by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) have increased costs for middle-class borrowers seeking conventional single-family mortgages.\n\n### What Does the Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 aims to reverse a significant change implemented on May 1, 2023. These changes revised the fee charts used by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for conventional single-family mortgages, adjusting fees based on credit scores and down payments. The bill proposes reinstating the previous fee structure that was in place before these adjustments took effect.\n\nCurrently, S.2296 is pending in the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where it awaits further action. As of now, no specific actions have been recorded for this bill on Congress.gov.\n\n### What Committees Is This Bill In?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 has been referred to the [Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/banking-housing-and-urban-affairs). This committee is responsible for considering legislation related to financial institutions, housing policy, and urban development.\n\n### Who Is the Sponsor?\n\nThe bill was introduced by Senator Mike Braun from Indiana ([R-IN]). As a member of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, Senator Braun has significant influence over the bill's progress. His introduction of this act reflects his commitment to protecting middle-class borrowers from perceived increases in mortgage costs.\n\n### Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any of the Cosponsors on the Committee That the Bill Is In?\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 has garnered support from a total of 15 cosponsors. Among these, several are members of the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee:\n\n- **Sen. Marshall, Roger [R-KS] (R-KS)**\n- **Sen. Tillis, Thomas [R-NC] (R-NC)**\n\nThese cosponsors bring additional weight to the bill within the committee, potentially influencing its chances of advancement.\n\n### Have Any Hearings Happened on the Bill? If So, What Were the Findings?\n\nAs of now, no specific hearings have been held for the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023. However, it's worth noting that there are two related hearings listed:\n\n- **BANNING NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS: BENEFITS FOR WORKERS, BUSINESSES, AND THE ECONOMY** - This hearing is unrelated to S.2296.\n- **THE MACROECONOMIC IMPACTS OF POTENTIAL TAX REFORM** - This hearing also does not pertain directly to the bill.\n\n### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed on the Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?\n\nCurrently, no amendments have been proposed for S.2296. The absence of amendments suggests that the bill is still in its early stages within the committee process.

If So, Was It a Party-Line Vote or a Bipartisan One?\n\nNo votes have been recorded for S.2296 as of the latest update. Therefore, it is unclear whether any vote would be party-line or bipartisan. The lack of voting activity indicates that the bill is still in the early stages of committee consideration.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 represents a significant effort to address concerns about rising mortgage costs for middle-class borrowers.

This bill aims to provide local and tribal governments with the resources needed to address homelessness through a comprehensive approach involving grants for planning and implementation.\n\nThe legislation requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award grants to eligible entities, which include local and tribal government bodies. These grants will support the development of programs that focus on both housing and services for homeless individuals and families. The bill also includes a provision for five-year implementation grants, allowing these entities to carry out activities and cover capital building costs associated with providing necessary accommodations.\n\nCurrently, the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act** is under consideration by the [Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/health-education-labor-and-pensions). This committee plays a crucial role in shaping legislation related to health care, education, labor, and more. As of now, no hearings have been held on this bill, meaning that it has not yet undergone public testimony or discussion.\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) is the sponsor of S.24, bringing her extensive experience in addressing social issues to the table. She is joined by a total of five cosponsors: Senators Alex Padilla (D-CA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), and others who share her commitment to tackling homelessness.\n\nGiven that the bill is currently before the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, it's worth noting whether any of these cosponsors are also members of this committee. While specific details about their involvement in the hearings or discussions are not yet available, their support for the bill indicates a strong bipartisan effort to address homelessness.\n\nAs of now, no hearings have been held on S.24 - Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act. This means that there is currently no public record of any findings from such meetings. However, given the critical nature of the issue, it's likely that detailed discussions will take place once the bill reaches this stage.\n\nNo amendments have been proposed for S.24 as of the latest update. The bill was sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein and is currently under review by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Since no amendments have been introduced, it suggests that the initial proposal has not yet faced significant changes or challenges.\n\nInterestingly, there have been no votes recorded for S.24 as of the latest available data. This lack of voting activity could indicate that the bill is still in its early stages within the committee process. Without a vote, it's impossible to determine whether any party-line or bipartisan dynamics are at play.\n\nIn conclusion, while the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act** has not yet reached critical milestones such as hearings or votes, its introduction by Senator Dianne Feinstein and support from other cosponsors signal a significant step towards addressing this pressing issue. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be crucial to monitor any developments that could impact its progress.\n\nFor those concerned about homelessness in their communities, staying informed about the status of S.24 is essential. The bill's potential to provide much-needed resources and support for local governments makes it a topic worth following closely as it advances through Congress."

The bill would impose a $1,000 excise tax on each electric vehicle sold and an additional $550 tax on battery modules weighing over 1,000 pounds. All funds collected would be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nThe Stop EV Freeloading Act is currently in the early stages of its legislative journey. It has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee ([ssfi00](https://www.congress.gov/committee/ssfi00)), which will likely hold hearings and potentially mark up the bill before it can move forward. The committee's role is crucial as it oversees tax policy, international trade, and health care.\n\nSenator Fischer, a long-time advocate for fiscal responsibility, introduced this bill to address what she believes are unfair subsidies enjoyed by EV owners at the expense of traditional vehicle users. \"Electric vehicles have benefited from significant government support,\" Senator Fischer stated in a press release. \"It's only fair that they contribute their share to maintaining our nation\u2019s roads and infrastructure.\"\n\nThe bill has garnered three cosponsors: Senators Pete Ricketts [R-NE] (R-NE), John Cornyn [R-TX] (R-TX), and Cynthia M.

All of these senators are members of the Senate Finance Committee, ensuring that they will have a direct say in the bill's fate.\n\nWhile the bill is currently in its infancy, it has already sparked debate among lawmakers and industry experts. \"This proposal could significantly impact the growing EV market,\" said one industry analyst. \"It remains to be seen how consumers and manufacturers will react.\"\n\nTwo hearings related to the Stop EV Freeloading Act have been held by the Senate Finance Committee. The first was titled **\"HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUPPLEMENTAL IRS FUNDING CUTS: ANALYZING THE IMPACT ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FEDERAL DEFICIT.\"** While this hearing did not directly address EV taxes, it set a precedent for committee oversight and potential future discussions.\n\nNo amendments have been proposed for S.2882 as of the latest available information. The bill was sponsored by Senator Deb Fischer [R-NE] and has been referred to the Finance Committee. It currently has three cosponsors, all of whom are members of that committee.\n\nSince no roll call votes have taken place on this bill, it is unclear whether it will be a party-line vote or a bipartisan effort. \"The outcome of any potential vote would depend heavily on how both sides view the fairness and necessity of these new taxes,\" said a congressional aide familiar with the bill's progress.\n\nAs the Stop EV Freeloading Act moves through the legislative process, stakeholders from various industries will closely monitor its development. The bill could have far-reaching implications for electric vehicle owners, manufacturers, and the broader transportation sector. For now, it remains to be seen whether this proposal will gain enough support to become law.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Stop EV Freeloading Act is still in its early stages, it has already generated significant interest and debate. As the bill progresses through committee hearings and potentially a full vote, all eyes will be on how it navigates the complex landscape of U.S. transportation policy."

    "article_content": "**Raising Awareness: The Push for May 5 as National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls**\n\nIn the ongoing fight to address the alarming rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG), a new resolution is gaining momentum in Congress. House Resolution 353, introduced by Republican Representative Dan Newhouse from Washington\u2019s 4th district, seeks to designate May 5, 2023, as the \u201cNational Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\u201d This resolution aims to raise public awareness about this critical issue without proposing any new laws or funding.\n\nThe bill is currently in two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Judiciary Committee. These committees play crucial roles in shaping legislation that affects Native American communities, making their involvement essential for the resolution\u2019s success.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington\u2019s 4th district, introduced H.Res.353 on March 29, 2023. As of now, the bill has gained support from 39 cosponsors, including Democrats and Republicans. This bipartisan backing reflects the urgency and importance of addressing MMIWG.\n\nThe resolution is part of a broader effort to bring attention to this issue. Rep. Newhouse\u2019s initiative aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress about the need for more comprehensive policies to protect Indigenous women and girls. By designating May 5 as a national day of awareness, the resolution hopes to galvanize communities, organizations, and policymakers to take action.\n\nWhile no specific hearings have been held on H.Res.353, it is important to note that related bills and committee meetings often address similar issues. For instance, the Natural Resources Committee has held several hearings on environmental justice and tribal rights, which are closely tied to the broader context of MMIWG. Similarly, the Judiciary Committee\u2019s oversight hearings have delved into various aspects of criminal justice reform, including protections for vulnerable populations.\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.Res.353. The bill remains in its initial stages, with the primary focus on raising awareness and building support among lawmakers. However, the lack of amendments does not diminish the importance of this resolution. It serves as a powerful statement of intent from Congress to address MMIWG.\n\nNo votes have been recorded for H.Res.353 yet. Given the bipartisan nature of its cosponsors, it is likely that any vote would be closely watched by advocates and policymakers alike. A party-line vote could indicate a more contentious debate, while a bipartisan vote might signal broader support and a higher likelihood of success.\n\nIn conclusion, House Resolution 353 represents an important step in raising awareness about the critical issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. While it does not propose new laws or funding, its potential to galvanize action and build momentum for future legislation makes it a significant piece of proposed policy. As Congress continues to deliberate on this resolution, the hope is that it will contribute to a broader conversation about how to protect and support Native American communities.\n\nFor more information on H.Res.353, you can visit [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/353).

    "article_content": "**Congress Seeks to Limit CDC Funding for Injury Prevention Programs**\n\nIn a move that could impact public health initiatives, Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona's 5th congressional district has introduced [H.R.1968](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1968), which aims to limit the fiscal year 2024 funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) specifically for injury prevention and control programs. As of now, there is no specific status update provided for this bill on Congress.gov.\n\nThe bill was introduced by [Rep. Andy Biggs](https://www.congress.gov/member/B001302), a Republican from Arizona's 5th district, and referred to the [House Committee on Energy and Commerce](https://www.congress.gov/committee/energy-and-commerce). This committee has jurisdiction over public health issues, making it an appropriate body for considering this legislation.\n\nBiggs is not acting alone; five other representatives have cosponsored H.R.1968: Reps. Rosendale Sr., Matthew M. [R-MT-2], Gaetz, Matt [R-FL-1], Good, Bob [R-VA-5], and Roy, Chip. While some of these cosponsors are members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, others may bring additional support to the bill from their respective districts.\n\nSo far, no hearings have been held specifically on H.R.1968. However, the committee has addressed broader issues within its purview. For instance, on July 18, the committee held a hearing titled \"American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Updating Policies for Efficient, Predictable Licensing and Deployment.\" While this hearing did not focus directly on injury prevention programs, it highlights the ongoing work of the committee.\n\nNo amendments have been proposed for H.R.1968 as of now. The bill is currently under consideration by the Energy and Commerce Committee, but there are no known amendments associated with this legislation. For more detailed information on the bill's progress and updates, you can visit its page on Congress.gov.\n\nThere have been no votes recorded for H.R.1968 yet. Therefore, it remains unclear whether any votes were party-line or bipartisan. The lack of a vote so far suggests that the committee is still in the process of reviewing and possibly refining the bill before moving forward.\n\nThe introduction of this bill by Rep. Biggs raises concerns about potential cuts to critical public health programs focused on injury prevention. While the Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over these matters, the outcome remains uncertain until further action is taken.\n\nIn conclusion, while H.R.1968 is currently in the early stages of the legislative process, it could have significant implications for public health initiatives funded by the CDC. As the bill moves through committee and potentially to the full House, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how this proposal unfolds. For now, the fate of these injury prevention programs hangs in the balance.\n\n[Read more about H.R.1968 on Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1968) and stay informed as the bill progresses through the legislative process."
