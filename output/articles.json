This bill aims to reduce energy expenses for consumers by addressing various aspects of the energy market. However, as of now, there is no specific status update available on this bill from Congress.gov [H.R.1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1).\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act was introduced by Representative Steve Scalise and has been referred to two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee. It currently has 20 cosponsors, indicating a level of bipartisan support among lawmakers [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/member/S001176).\n\nBoth of these committees are crucial for the bill's progress. The Natural Resources Committee focuses on issues related to natural resources, water, and energy development, while the Energy and Commerce Committee handles matters concerning energy policy, telecommunications, and healthcare. Given that the bill is in its early stages, it\u2019s not surprising that no hearings have been held yet [H.R.1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1).\n\nSince no hearings have taken place, there are currently no findings to report on the bill's proposals. Hearings would typically involve discussions with experts, stakeholders, and other interested parties to gather information and opinions before the bill can move forward in the legislative process.\n\nAs for amendments, none have been proposed as of now [H.R.1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text). Amendments are introduced by members of Congress and can address various aspects of the bill, such as changing provisions or adding new sections to better align with policy goals.\n\nThe bill has not yet advanced to a full House vote. Therefore, we cannot determine if any votes were party-line or bipartisan at this time [H.R.1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/actions). For the latest updates on the bill\u2019s progress, you can visit Congress.gov and follow its status updates as they become available.\n\nWhile the Lower Energy Costs Act has gained some traction with 20 cosponsors, it remains in the early stages of the legislative process.

As lawmakers continue to grapple with energy costs, this bill could play a significant role in shaping future policies.\n\nFor now, the Lower Energy Costs Act is waiting its turn on Capitol Hill.

Now, nearly two decades later, a new bill seeks to ensure that memory endures through the establishment of a memorial and museum dedicated to the victims. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act (H.R.5401) was introduced by Rep. Anthony D'Esposito [R-NY-4] on Congress.gov.\n\nThe bill aims to create a lasting tribute to those who perished in the attacks, providing a place where visitors can learn about the events of that day and the heroes who responded. It authorizes funding for the construction, operation, and maintenance of these memorials and museums, ensuring they remain accessible to future generations.\n\nCurrently, H.R.5401 is before the Natural Resources Committee, which handles legislation related to public lands, national parks, and other environmental issues. This committee plays a crucial role in determining whether the bill moves forward or faces delays. As of now, it has 20 cosponsors from both parties, indicating broad support for the initiative.\n\nRep. D'Esposito [R-NY-4] is the primary sponsor of H.R.5401. His introduction of this legislation underscores his commitment to preserving the memory of those who lost their lives on that fateful day and ensuring that future generations understand the significance of 9/11.\n\nWhile the bill has gained traction with its sponsors, it remains in an early stage of the legislative process. No hearings have been held yet, nor have any amendments been proposed. This means that the Natural Resources Committee will need to take action before the bill can move forward. The committee\u2019s next steps could include scheduling a hearing or voting on whether to advance the legislation.\n\nInterestingly, none of the cosponsors serve on the Natural Resources Committee. This could potentially slow down the process if there is no direct oversight from members who are familiar with the bill's content and goals. However, the broad support among lawmakers suggests that the committee may still find a way to move the bill forward.\n\nAs for amendments, H.R.5401 has not yet seen any proposed changes. This means that the original version of the legislation remains intact as it moves through the legislative process. Any future amendments would need to be carefully crafted and debated by lawmakers before they can be added to the bill.\n\nCurrently, there have been no votes on H.R.5401. The bill is still in the referral stage, meaning that it has not yet reached a full House vote. Given its current status as \"N/A\" (Not Applicable), it indicates that the bill has not advanced far enough to warrant voting.\n\nThe journey of H.R.5401 from introduction to enactment will be crucial for ensuring that the memory of 9/11 remains alive and relevant. As the bill moves through its early stages, supporters hope that it will gain momentum and eventually become law. The establishment of a memorial and museum dedicated to the victims would serve as a powerful reminder of the resilience and unity that emerged in the aftermath of one of history\u2019s darkest days.\n\nFor more detailed information on H.R.5401, you can visit its page on [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5401).

Known as the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act (S.24)**, this legislation seeks to address one of America\u2019s most pressing social issues.\n\nFeinstein, a long-time advocate for affordable housing and homelessness solutions, introduced S.24 on January 25, 2021. The bill was immediately referred to the **Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee (HELP)**, where it awaits further action. As of now, there are no specific updates or findings related to this bill on Congress.gov.\n\nThe HELP Committee is well-suited for this task, given its focus on issues like health care, education, labor, and pensions\u2014areas that intersect significantly with the challenges of homelessness. The committee\u2019s role will be crucial in shaping the bill's direction and ensuring it aligns with broader policy goals.\n\nSenator Feinstein has a strong track record of championing legislation to combat homelessness.

The HELP Committee will play a critical role in shaping the bill's future, and any votes or amendments could significantly impact its ultimate success.\n\nAs this legislation moves forward, it is crucial for all stakeholders\u2014congressional members, advocacy groups, and concerned citizens\u2014to stay informed and engaged.
