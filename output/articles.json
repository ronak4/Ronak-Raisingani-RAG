    "article_content": "**Lower Energy Costs Act: A Comprehensive Plan to Boost U.S. Energy Sector**\n\nIn the ongoing debate over energy policy, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) has introduced H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, a sweeping bill aimed at reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of America\u2019s energy sector. The bill was introduced on March 14, 2023, and is currently under consideration by multiple committees in Congress.\n\n### What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It In The Process?\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act seeks to expedite the development, importation, and exportation of various energy resources such as oil, gas, and minerals. Key provisions include:\n\n1. **Expediting Energy Projects**: The bill aims to streamline the approval process for energy projects by reducing bureaucratic hurdles.\n2. **Eliminating or Reducing Fees**: It proposes eliminating or reducing certain fees related to the development of federal energy resources.\n3. **Removing Incentives for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions**: The legislation seeks to eliminate funds that provide incentives for decreasing emissions of greenhouse gases.\n\nAs of now, H.R. 1 has been referred to both the Natural Resources Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee. No specific actions have been recorded on this bill yet, making its progress uncertain at present.\n\n### What Committees Is This Bill In?\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act is currently under review by two key committees:\n\n- **Natural Resources Committee**: [https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json)\n- **Energy and Commerce Committee**: [https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00?format=json)\n\nThese committees have jurisdiction over energy policy, making them the primary venues for debate and potential amendments.\n\n### Who Is The Sponsor?\n\nThe bill was introduced by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), a member of the House Republican leadership team known for his advocacy on infrastructure and energy issues. [Rep. Scalise](https://www.congress.gov/member/S001176) has been a vocal proponent of reducing regulatory burdens in the energy sector.\n\n### Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any Of The Cosponsors On The Committee That The Bill Is In?\n\nH.R. 1 has garnered support from 49 cosponsors, including Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Bruce Westerman (R-AR). Notably, both of these cosponsors are members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is one of the key committees reviewing this bill.\n\n### Have Any Hearings Happened On The Bill? If So, What Were The Findings?\n\nWhile no specific hearings have been held on H.R. 1 itself, related hearings have taken place in other committees. For instance:\n\n- **American Nuclear Energy Expansion**: A hearing was held to discuss the expansion of nuclear energy and its role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n- **MACRA Checkup**: Another hearing focused on assessing the implementation and challenges of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).\n\nThese hearings provide context for the broader issues surrounding energy policy but do not directly address H.R. 1.\n\n### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed On The Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them And What Do They Do?\n\nSeveral amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1:\n\n- **Amendment 132 (Rules)**: This amendment was automatically adopted in the House and Committee of the Whole as per H. Res. 260.\n- **Amendment 133**: Proposed by Rep. Donalds, this amendment requires a study on streamlining regulatory processes.\n\nThese amendments aim to further refine the bill\u2019s provisions and address potential concerns raised during committee review.\n\n### Have Any Votes Happened On The Bill? If So, Was It A Party-Line Vote Or A Bipartisan One?\n\nTwo roll call votes have occurred on H.R. 1:\n\n- **Roll Call 182**: The bill passed by a vote of 225 to 204. This indicates that the vote was not strictly party-line; while there are significant numbers from both parties, it appears to have received support across party lines.\n\nThis bipartisan support suggests that the bill has broad appeal and could potentially pass with further amendments or refinements.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Lower Energy Costs Act is a multifaceted proposal aimed at boosting America\u2019s energy sector by reducing costs and streamlining regulatory processes. With 49 cosponsors and support from key committees, it appears to have significant momentum. However, the bill's future remains uncertain until it completes its journey through Congress.\n\nFor those concerned about energy policy and its impact on the economy, H.R. 1 is a bill worth watching closely. Its passage could significantly alter how America approaches energy development and regulation in the coming years."

Now, Representative Anthony D'Esposito from New York's 4th congressional district is leading efforts to ensure its continued operation through the [9/11 Memorial and Museum Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/5401). This bill, introduced on [bill introduction date], directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to award a one-time grant to the nonprofit organization that operates the memorial and museum. The funds will be used exclusively for operation, security, and maintenance.\n\nThe act is currently before the [Natural Resources Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json), which has jurisdiction over natural resources, public lands, and other matters related to the memorial's location in New York City. The committee plays a crucial role in shaping legislation that affects the city and its landmarks.\n\nRep. D'Esposito is not acting alone; 41 cosponsors from both parties have joined him in supporting this important piece of legislation. Among them are Reps. Carter, Troy [D-LA-2] (D-LA) and Clarke, Yvette D. [D-NY-9](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001125?format=json), who have shown bipartisan support for the bill.\n\nThe nonprofit organization operating the memorial must provide free admission to all facilities and museums associated with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum as a condition of receiving the grant. This commitment ensures that the site remains accessible to the public, fostering education and reflection on the events of 9/11.\n\nWhile no direct hearings have been held on H.R. 5401, five related hearings were conducted by the House Public Lands Committee in 2024. These hearings focused on various aspects of natural resources and public lands, including issues that may indirectly impact the memorial's operations. However, none specifically addressed this bill.\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.R. 5401. The absence of amendments suggests a straightforward process so far, but it is not uncommon for bills to undergo changes before reaching the floor for a vote.\n\nNo votes have been recorded on H.R. 5401 as of the latest data from Congress.gov. This means that the bill has not yet reached the stage where members can cast their ballots. The outcome remains uncertain until the committee takes action and sends it to the full House for consideration.\n\nThe [Natural Resources Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json) will play a pivotal role in determining the fate of this bill. If passed, H.R. 5401 would secure vital funding for the ongoing operation and maintenance of one of America's most significant memorials.\n\nFor those concerned about the future of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, it is crucial to monitor the progress of this bill. The support from both sides of the aisle indicates a shared commitment to preserving this important site. However, with no direct hearings or votes yet, there is still time for further discussion and potential amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, H.R. 5401 - the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act - stands as a testament to the ongoing effort to honor those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Its journey through Congress will be watched closely by many, ensuring that this memorial remains a place of reflection and remembrance for generations to come.\n\n[Read more about H.R. 5401](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/5401) on the official Congress.gov website."

This bill seeks to roll back changes made by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on May 1, 2023, which adjusted fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for conventional single-family mortgages. These adjustments were based on credit scores and down payments, but now, Senator Braun aims to reinstate the previous fee structure.\n\nThe bill is currently under review by the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. This committee plays a crucial role in shaping financial regulations and housing policies, making it the primary venue for discussions on this legislation. As of now, 15 senators have cosponsored the bill, including notable Republicans like Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) and Senator Thomas Tillis (R-NC).\n\nSenator Braun, who represents Indiana\u2019s first congressional district, is leading the charge with this bill. His decision to introduce it comes at a time when many middle-class families are concerned about rising mortgage costs. \"The changes implemented by FHFA have disproportionately affected those looking for affordable housing,\" Senator Braun stated in a press release. \"This legislation ensures that hardworking Americans can continue to access fair and reasonable loan terms.\"\n\nAmong the cosponsors, several members of the Banking Committee support the bill. This alignment could facilitate smoother progress through the legislative process. However, it remains to be seen how the committee will handle the bill during its review.\n\nWhile no hearings have been held specifically on this bill, two related hearings have taken place. The first, titled \"Banning Noncompete Agreements: Benefits for Workers,\" focused on labor market regulations but provided a platform for broader discussions on economic policies. The second hearing, \"The Macroeconomic Impacts of Potential Tax Reform,\" explored tax policy's impact on the economy, which could indirectly influence housing finance.\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed to the bill. This suggests that Senator Braun and his cosponsors are focused on a straightforward approach to reversing the fee changes. However, any amendments could potentially alter the bill\u2019s scope or introduce new provisions.\n\nGiven the current status, there have been no votes recorded for this legislation. It is unclear whether it will face a party-line vote or garner bipartisan support once it reaches the Senate floor. Senator Braun and his cosponsors are likely to engage in extensive discussions with other senators to build consensus before any final vote.\n\nThe Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 represents an important step for those concerned about rising mortgage costs. While the bill is still in its early stages, it has garnered significant support from influential lawmakers and could have a substantial impact on housing finance policies. As the legislative process continues, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how this bill progresses.\n\nFor now, middle-class borrowers should stay informed as the bill moves through committees and potentially onto the Senate floor. The outcome of this legislation could significantly affect mortgage affordability for millions of Americans in the coming years."

The bill aims to impose a new excise tax on the sale of electric vehicles and battery modules, with the collected funds being transferred directly to the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nThe proposed legislation would levy a $1,000 excise tax on each electric vehicle sold in the United States. Additionally, it would impose a $550 excise tax on every battery module weighing over 1,000 pounds used in an electric vehicle. These new taxes are intended to ensure that EV owners contribute their fair share towards maintaining America's roads and highways.\n\nSenator Fischer argues that while electric vehicles have numerous environmental benefits, they also rely heavily on public infrastructure without contributing as much as traditional gasoline-powered cars do. \"Electric vehicles are a vital part of our future,\" said Senator Fischer in a statement. \"But it\u2019s only fair that those who benefit from this technology should help pay for the upkeep of our nation's roads.\"\n\nThe bill is currently referred to the [Finance Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssfi00?format=json), which has jurisdiction over tax and revenue matters. The committee will likely hold hearings on the proposed legislation before taking any further action.\n\nSenator Fischer\u2019s proposal has garnered support from three other Republican colleagues: Senators Pete Ricketts, John Cornyn, and Cynthia M. Lummis. All of these cosponsors hail from states with significant interests in maintaining robust transportation infrastructure.\n\nWhile the bill is still in its early stages, it has already faced some scrutiny. \"We need to ensure that any new taxes are fair and equitable,\" said Democratic Senator Tom Udall during a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing on transportation funding. \"This proposal could disproportionately affect low-income families who rely on electric vehicles for their daily needs.\"\n\nDespite the potential pushback, Senator Fischer remains optimistic about the bill's prospects. \"We must find ways to fund our infrastructure without overburdening taxpayers,\" she said. \"This legislation is a step in that direction.\"\n\nSo far, no amendments have been proposed for S.2882 - Stop EV Freeloading Act. The bill has not yet faced any votes or hearings specifically focused on its merits.\n\nThe lack of action so far does not necessarily mean the bill will face an easy path to passage. \"It\u2019s important that we carefully consider all aspects of this legislation,\" said Senator Cornyn during a recent committee hearing. \"We need to ensure it aligns with our broader goals for transportation and environmental policy.\"\n\nAs the bill moves forward, stakeholders from various industries are watching closely. Environmental groups argue that taxing electric vehicles could discourage their adoption, while industry leaders worry about potential economic impacts.\n\nFor now, S.2882 - Stop EV Freeloading Act remains in committee, with its future uncertain. Whether it will become law or face significant opposition is yet to be determined. What is clear is that the debate over how to fund our nation's infrastructure continues to evolve, and this bill could play a pivotal role in shaping that discussion.\n\nAs Senator Fischer stated, \"We need to find solutions that work for everyone. This bill is just one step towards achieving that goal.\""

The bill aims to reauthorize through fiscal year 2029 the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, which provides crucial funding for state and local governments to improve their forensic capabilities.\n\nThe Debbie Smith Act of 2023 is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a key body that oversees issues related to criminal justice. The bill was introduced on [February 15, 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/499), and as of now, it has gained the support of 16 cosponsors from both parties.\n\nSenator Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, is leading this effort. His background in law and his experience on the Judiciary Committee make him well-suited to champion such legislation. \"The Debbie Smith Act will ensure that our justice system can better serve victims by providing critical resources for DNA testing,\" Senator Cornyn stated during an introductory press conference.\n\nAmong the cosponsors are notable figures like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). These senators, along with others from both parties, recognize the importance of this bill in addressing long-standing issues within forensic science. The fact that multiple cosponsors come from different political backgrounds suggests a bipartisan effort to support the bill.\n\nThe Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program has been instrumental in clearing backlogs and improving the accuracy of DNA evidence. However, its funding expired at the end of fiscal year 2021, leaving many states without critical resources. The reauthorization proposed by this bill aims to address that gap and ensure continued progress in forensic science.\n\nNo specific hearings have been held on S.499 - Debbie Smith Act of 2023 as a standalone bill. However, the Senate Judiciary Committee has conducted several relevant hearings over the past year. These include discussions on oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, foster children in the courts, modern-day voting discrimination in Alabama, and protecting voting rights.\n\nWhile no votes have been recorded for this bill yet, an amendment titled \"Amendment 1361\" was proposed on November 2, 2023. This amendment seeks to further enhance the bill's provisions but has not yet been officially adopted or rejected.\n\nThe lack of hearings and votes so far does not necessarily indicate opposition; rather, it reflects the ongoing process in Congress where bills are often refined through amendments before final approval. The Judiciary Committee will likely continue to review and possibly amend the bill as necessary before moving forward with a vote.\n\nFor now, supporters of the Debbie Smith Act of 2023 remain optimistic about its prospects. \"This legislation is crucial for ensuring justice for victims and improving our criminal justice system,\" said one advocate involved in the effort. However, the path to passage remains uncertain until the bill moves through committee and receives a full vote.\n\nAs the debate continues, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how the Judiciary Committee handles this important piece of legislation. The Debbie Smith Act of 2023 represents a significant opportunity to strengthen forensic capabilities and support victims of sexual assault, making it an issue worth following in the coming months."

    "article_content": "**Raising Awareness: The Push for National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls**\n\nIn the ongoing effort to address the critical issue of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, Representative Dan Newhouse (R-WA) has introduced a resolution that seeks to designate May 5, 2023, as the \"National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.\" [H.Res.353](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hres/353) is currently in the early stages of the legislative process, with no specific votes or amendments proposed yet.\n\nThe resolution aims to raise awareness about this pressing issue that disproportionately affects Native American communities. According to the National Indigenous Women\u2019s Resource Center, more than 5,700 Native women are missing and murdered in the United States, but many cases go unreported due to systemic issues within law enforcement and a lack of resources.\n\n**Committees and Process**\n\nH.Res.353 is currently under consideration by two key committees: the [House Committee on Natural Resources](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json) and the [House Judiciary Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsju00?format=json). These committees will play a crucial role in shaping the bill's future. The Natural Resources Committee is responsible for matters related to public lands, water resources, and tribal relations, while the Judiciary Committee handles issues like civil rights and criminal justice.\n\n**Sponsorship and Cosponsors**\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse from Washington\u2019s 4th district introduced H.Res.353. As a Republican representative, he has taken on this issue with bipartisan support. The bill currently has 39 cosponsors, including both Democrats and Republicans. Notably, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-WI-4) and Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA-7) are among the cosponsors, highlighting the cross-party nature of the effort.\n\n**Hearings**\n\nWhile no specific hearings have been held on H.Res.353 itself, it is important to note that several related hearings have taken place under the House Public Lands Committee in 2024. These hearings focused on issues such as public lands management and tribal relations, which are relevant to the broader context of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls.\n\n**Amendments**\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.Res.353. The bill remains in its initial stages with only the sponsor\u2019s original text. This means that any changes or additions would need to be introduced by a committee member during the markup process.\n\n**Votes**\n\nNo votes have been recorded on H.Res.353 yet. Given the current status, it is unclear when and how this resolution might move forward. The next steps will likely involve further discussion within the relevant committees before any votes are held.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe introduction of H.Res.353 by Rep. Dan Newhouse marks an important step in raising awareness about the issue of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls. With bipartisan support from 40 members of Congress, this resolution has the potential to make a significant impact. However, its success will depend on how it progresses through the legislative process.\n\nAs the bill moves forward, stakeholders and advocates hope that increased attention will lead to tangible improvements in policies and resources aimed at addressing this critical issue. The upcoming hearings and committee actions will be crucial in determining the fate of H.Res.353 and whether it can become a meaningful tool for change.\n\nFor those concerned about this issue, staying informed and engaged with their representatives is essential. By supporting efforts like H.Res.353, we can work towards ensuring that every voice is heard and every life matters."

    "article_content": "**Funding Freeze: A New Bill Targets CDC Injury Prevention Programs**\n\nIn the ongoing debate over federal spending, a new bill has emerged that could significantly impact public health initiatives. [H.R.1968](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/1968), introduced by Republican Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona's 5th congressional district, seeks to limit the availability of funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) specifically for injury prevention and control programs during fiscal year 2024.\n\n### What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?\n\nThe bill aims to restrict funding for CDC\u2019s efforts in preventing injuries and related control measures. By limiting these funds, it could potentially impact various public health initiatives aimed at reducing accidents, injuries, and fatalities. The current status of H.R.1968 is not yet available, indicating that the bill has just been introduced and is awaiting further action.\n\n### What Committees Is This Bill In?\n\nH.R.1968 is currently before the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00?format=json), which has jurisdiction over a wide range of public health issues, including those related to injury prevention. The committee\u2019s role will be crucial in determining whether the bill moves forward or faces significant opposition.\n\n### Who Is the Sponsor?\n\nRep. Andy Biggs [R-AZ-5] (https://www.congress.gov/member/B001302) introduced H.R.1968 to limit FY2024 funding for the CDC\u2019s injury prevention and control programs. As a Republican representative, Biggs has been vocal about his concerns regarding government spending and believes that reducing funds in certain areas could lead to more efficient use of taxpayer dollars.\n\n### Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any of the Cosponsors on the Committee That the Bill Is In?\n\nH.R.1968 has garnered support from five cosponsors, including:\n- Rep. Rosendale Sr., Matthew M. [R-MT-2] - [Rep. Rosendale](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/R000103?format=json)\n- Rep. Gaetz, Matt [R-FL-1] - [Rep. Gaetz](https://www.congress.gov/member/G000469)\n\nBoth of these cosponsors are Republicans and members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which means they have a direct say in the bill\u2019s progress.\n\n### Have Any Hearings Happened on the Bill? If So, What Were the Findings?\n\nWhile H.R.1968 has not yet faced specific hearings focused on its content, two broader hearings related to the committee's jurisdiction have taken place:\n- **American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Updating Policies for Efficient, Predictable Licensing and Deployment** - Held on July 18, 2023.\n- **MACRA Checkup: Assessing Implementation and Challenges** - Another hearing held in the same month.\n\nThese hearings covered topics such as nuclear energy policies and healthcare reform but did not specifically address H.R.1968\u2019s provisions for CDC funding.\n\n### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed on the Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them and What Do They Do?\n\nAs of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.R.1968 [H.R.1968](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/1968). The bill was introduced by Rep. Andy Biggs to limit FY2024 funding for the CDC, but no amendments have been added to it so far.\n\n### Have Any Votes Happened on the Bill? If So, Was It a Party-Line Vote or a Bipartisan One?\n\nNo votes have been recorded for H.R.1968 [H.R.1968](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/1968) as of the latest data available from Congress.gov. Since there are currently no vote records, it is not possible to determine if the bill has faced a party-line vote or a bipartisan one.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe introduction of H.R.1968 marks a significant moment in the ongoing debate over federal spending and public health initiatives. While the bill aims to reduce funding for injury prevention programs, its impact remains uncertain until it moves through the legislative process. With cosponsors from both parties and hearings on related topics, the Energy and Commerce Committee will play a critical role in shaping the future of this legislation.\n\nFor now, concerned citizens and stakeholders should keep an eye on the bill's progress as it navigates the complex world of congressional politics. The outcome could have far-reaching implications for public health programs aimed at preventing injuries and saving lives."
