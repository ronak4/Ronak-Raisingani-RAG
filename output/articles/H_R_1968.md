**Congress Seeks to Limit CDC Funding for Injury Prevention Programs**

In a move that could impact public health initiatives, Representative Andy Biggs from Arizona's 5th congressional district has introduced [H.R.1968](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1968), which aims to limit the fiscal year 2024 funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) specifically for injury prevention and control programs. As of now, there is no specific status update provided for this bill on Congress.gov.

The bill was introduced by [Rep. Andy Biggs](https://www.congress.gov/member/B001302), a Republican from Arizona's 5th district, and referred to the [House Committee on Energy and Commerce](https://www.congress.gov/committee/energy-and-commerce). This committee has jurisdiction over public health issues, making it an appropriate body for considering this legislation.

Biggs is not acting alone; five other representatives have cosponsored H.R.1968: Reps. Rosendale Sr., Matthew M. [R-MT-2], Gaetz, Matt [R-FL-1], Good, Bob [R-VA-5], and Roy, Chip. While some of these cosponsors are members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, others may bring additional support to the bill from their respective districts.

So far, no hearings have been held specifically on H.R.1968. However, the committee has addressed broader issues within its purview. For instance, on July 18, the committee held a hearing titled "American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Updating Policies for Efficient, Predictable Licensing and Deployment." While this hearing did not focus directly on injury prevention programs, it highlights the ongoing work of the committee.

No amendments have been proposed for H.R.1968 as of now. The bill is currently under consideration by the Energy and Commerce Committee, but there are no known amendments associated with this legislation. For more detailed information on the bill's progress and updates, you can visit its page on Congress.gov.

There have been no votes recorded for H.R.1968 yet. Therefore, it remains unclear whether any votes were party-line or bipartisan. The lack of a vote so far suggests that the committee is still in the process of reviewing and possibly refining the bill before moving forward.

The introduction of this bill by Rep. Biggs raises concerns about potential cuts to critical public health programs focused on injury prevention. While the Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over these matters, the outcome remains uncertain until further action is taken.

In conclusion, while H.R.1968 is currently in the early stages of the legislative process, it could have significant implications for public health initiatives funded by the CDC. As the bill moves through committee and potentially to the full House, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how this proposal unfolds. For now, the fate of these injury prevention programs hangs in the balance.
