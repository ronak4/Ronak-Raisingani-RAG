**Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023: A Bid to Roll Back Housing Fees**

In the ongoing debate over housing finance reform, Senator Mike Braun from Indiana has introduced the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 (S.2296).

The bill proposes reinstating the previous fee structure that was in place before these adjustments took effect.
