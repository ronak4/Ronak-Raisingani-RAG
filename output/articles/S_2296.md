**Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023: Aiming to Roll Back Mortgage Fee Changes**

In the ongoing debate over housing finance regulations, Senator Mike Braun from Indiana has introduced the Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 (S.2296). This bill seeks to address concerns that changes made by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) on May 1, 2023, have increased costs for middle-class borrowers seeking conventional single-family mortgages.

### What Does the Bill Do? Where Is It in the Process?

The Middle Class Borrower Protection Act of 2023 aims to reverse the fee adjustments introduced by FHFA. Specifically, it reinstates the previous fee structure that was in place before May 1, 2023. These changes revised the fee charts based on a mortgagor's credit score and down payment, leading to higher costs for many borrowers.

Currently, the bill is still pending and has not yet moved beyond its initial referral.
