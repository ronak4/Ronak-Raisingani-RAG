**Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer Proposes New Tax on Electric Vehicles to Fund Highway Trust Fund**

In an effort to address the growing demand for electric vehicles (EVs) and fund critical infrastructure projects, Nebraska Republican Senator Deb Fischer has introduced a new bill aimed at imposing additional taxes on EV sales. The **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882) would impose a $1,000 excise tax on the sale of an electric vehicle and a $550 excise tax on battery modules weighing over 1,000 pounds. The collected funds would be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund.

The bill defines an electric vehicle as a light-duty motor vehicle with a gross weight less than 8,500 pounds that is primarily powered by electricity. This includes both plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. By targeting these specific types of vehicles, Senator Fischer hopes to ensure that those who benefit from the infrastructure improvements pay their fair share.

The **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882) is currently referred to the Senate Finance Committee for consideration. This committee has a crucial role in shaping tax legislation, making it the first stop for this bill.

Senator Fischer [F000463](https://www.congress.gov/member/F000463), who sponsored the bill, represents Nebraska’s second congressional district and is known for her focus on infrastructure and transportation issues. The senator has been vocal about the need to fund highway projects and ensure that all users of these roads contribute fairly.

The bill currently has three cosponsors: Senator Pete Ricketts [R-NE], Senator John Cornyn [R-TX], and Senator Cynthia M. Lummis [R-WY]. Notably, two of the cosponsors—Senators Ricketts and Lummis—are also members of the Senate Finance Committee. This alignment could expedite the bill’s progress through committee.

So far, there have been no hearings held on the **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882). The first hearing related to this issue was titled "HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUPPLEMENTAL IRS FUNDING CUTS: ANALYZING THE IMPACT ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FED" [https://www.congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov), which took place on May 16, 2023. However, this hearing was not specifically focused on the EV tax bill.

As of now, no amendments have been proposed for the **Stop EV Freeloading Act** [S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882). The bill is currently in its early stages and has not yet faced any votes.

The introduction of this bill reflects a broader debate about how to fund infrastructure projects as the transportation landscape evolves. With more Americans choosing electric vehicles, Senator Fischer’s proposal aims to ensure that these users contribute financially to maintaining roads and highways. However, critics argue that such taxes could discourage EV adoption, which is critical for reducing carbon emissions.

As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be interesting to see how stakeholders respond. The Senate Finance Committee will play a pivotal role in shaping the final version of the legislation. If passed, this bill could set a precedent for future transportation funding measures.

For now, supporters and opponents are closely watching the progress of S.2882. Whether it becomes law or not, the debate surrounding electric vehicle taxes is likely to continue as lawmakers grapple with balancing environmental goals with fiscal realities.
