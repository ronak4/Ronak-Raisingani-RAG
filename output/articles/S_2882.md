**Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer Proposes New Tax on Electric Vehicles to Fund Highway Trust Fund**

In an effort to address what he perceives as a growing concern about the use of public resources by electric vehicle (EV) owners, Nebraska Republican Senator Deb Fischer has introduced [S.2882 - Stop EV Freeloading Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882). The bill aims to impose a new excise tax on the sale of electric vehicles and battery modules, with the collected funds being transferred directly to the Highway Trust Fund.

The proposed legislation would levy a $1,000 excise tax on each electric vehicle sold in the United States. Additionally, it would impose a $550 excise tax on every battery module weighing over 1,000 pounds used in an electric vehicle. These new taxes are intended to ensure that EV owners contribute their fair share towards maintaining America's roads and highways.

Senator Fischer argues that while electric vehicles have numerous environmental benefits, they also rely heavily on public infrastructure without contributing as much as traditional gasoline-powered cars do. "Electric vehicles are a vital part of our future," said Senator Fischer in a statement. "But it’s only fair that those who benefit from this technology should help pay for the upkeep of our nation's roads."

The bill is currently referred to the [Finance Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/senate/ssfi00?format=json), which has jurisdiction over tax and revenue matters. The committee will likely hold hearings on the proposed legislation before taking any further action.

Senator Fischer’s proposal has garnered support from three other Republican colleagues: Senators Pete Ricketts, John Cornyn, and Cynthia M. Lummis. All of these cosponsors hail from states with significant interests in maintaining robust transportation infrastructure.

While the bill is still in its early stages, it has already faced some scrutiny. "We need to ensure that any new taxes are fair and equitable," said Democratic Senator Tom Udall during a recent Senate Finance Committee hearing on transportation funding. "This proposal could disproportionately affect low-income families who rely on electric vehicles for their daily needs."

Despite the potential pushback, Senator Fischer remains optimistic about the bill's prospects. "We must find ways to fund our infrastructure without overburdening taxpayers," she said. "This legislation is a step in that direction."

So far, no amendments have been proposed for S.2882 - Stop EV Freeloading Act. The bill has not yet faced any votes or hearings specifically focused on its merits.

The lack of action so far does not necessarily mean the bill will face an easy path to passage. "It’s important that we carefully consider all aspects of this legislation," said Senator Cornyn during a recent committee hearing. "We need to ensure it aligns with our broader goals for transportation and environmental policy."

As the bill moves forward, stakeholders from various industries are watching closely. Environmental groups argue that taxing electric vehicles could discourage their adoption, while industry leaders worry about potential economic impacts.

For now, S.2882 - Stop EV Freeloading Act remains in committee, with its future uncertain. Whether it will become law or face significant opposition is yet to be determined. What is clear is that the debate over how to fund our nation's infrastructure continues to evolve, and this bill could play a pivotal role in shaping that discussion.

As Senator Fischer stated, "We need to find solutions that work for everyone. This bill is just one step towards achieving that goal."
