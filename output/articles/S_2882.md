On September 21, 2023, Senator Deb Fischer from Nebraska introduced the Stop EV Freeloading Act (S.2882) in the Senate. The bill aims to impose new excise taxes on electric vehicle sales and battery modules, with the collected funds directed towards the Highway Trust Fund for transportation-related projects.

The proposed legislation would levy a $1,000 tax on each electric vehicle sold and a $550 tax on each battery module weighing over 1,000 pounds used in an electric vehicle. The bill defines an electric vehicle as a light-duty motor vehicle with a gross weight of less than 8,500 pounds that is capable of being propelled by an electric motor. These new taxes are intended to generate additional revenue for infrastructure projects and address what some lawmakers perceive as the "freeloading" issue faced by traditional fuel-based vehicles.

The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on Finance, where it will undergo further scrutiny and potential amendments before any votes can be taken. As of now, no specific actions or hearings have been scheduled. The committee plays a crucial role in shaping legislation related to taxation and trade policy, making its review process essential for the bill's progress.

Senator Deb Fischer is the primary sponsor of S.2882, representing Nebraska as a Republican. She has been a vocal advocate for addressing infrastructure funding challenges through innovative means such as this proposed excise tax on electric vehicles. The bill also has three cosponsors: Senator Pete Ricketts from Nebraska, Senator John Cornyn from Texas, and Senator Cynthia M. Lummis from Wyoming.

Interestingly, one of the cosponsors, Senator John Cornyn, is a member of the Finance Committee, which means he will be directly involved in reviewing the bill's provisions. This overlap between sponsorship and committee membership could influence the bill’s trajectory through the legislative process.

Notably, no hearings have been held for this bill as of the latest update. The absence of public testimony or detailed discussions on the proposed excise taxes might limit the transparency and scrutiny typically associated with such significant financial measures.

Amendments to S.2882 have not yet been proposed, suggesting that the current version is still under consideration by the Finance Committee. However, given the complexity of tax legislation, it's likely that amendments will be introduced as the bill moves forward.

Regarding votes, no roll call votes have taken place for this bill. The summary indicates that there are currently no recorded votes on S.2882, meaning its fate remains uncertain until further committee action and potential floor debates in the Senate.

The Stop EV Freeloading Act is a significant piece of legislation that could reshape how electric vehicles contribute to infrastructure funding. As it progresses through the legislative process, stakeholders will be watching closely for any developments, especially as the bill moves from the Finance Committee towards possible votes on the Senate floor.

In conclusion, S.2882 remains at an early stage in its journey through Congress. With no specific actions or hearings scheduled and no recorded votes to date, the bill's future is uncertain but potentially impactful. As it continues to be reviewed by the Finance Committee, any amendments or changes could significantly alter its final form and ultimate fate.
