**Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer Proposes New Tax on Electric Vehicles**

In an effort to address what she deems as "freeloading" by electric vehicle (EV) owners, Nebraska Republican Senator Deb Fischer has introduced the Stop EV Freeloading Act ([S.2882](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2882)). The bill would impose a $1,000 excise tax on each electric vehicle sold and an additional $550 tax on battery modules weighing over 1,000 pounds. All funds collected would be transferred to the Highway Trust Fund.

The Stop EV Freeloading Act is currently in the early stages of its legislative journey. It has been referred to the Senate Finance Committee ([ssfi00](https://www.congress.gov/committee/ssfi00)), which will likely hold hearings and potentially mark up the bill before it can move forward. The committee's role is crucial as it oversees tax policy, international trade, and health care.

Senator Fischer, a long-time advocate for fiscal responsibility, introduced this bill to address what she believes are unfair subsidies enjoyed by EV owners at the expense of traditional vehicle users. "Electric vehicles have benefited from significant government support," Senator Fischer stated in a press release. "It's only fair that they contribute their share to maintaining our nationâ€™s roads and infrastructure."

The bill has garnered three cosponsors: Senators Pete Ricketts [R-NE] (R-NE), John Cornyn [R-TX] (R-TX), and Cynthia M. Lummis [R-WY] (R-WY). All of these senators are members of the Senate Finance Committee, ensuring that they will have a direct say in the bill's fate.

While the bill is currently in its infancy, it has already sparked debate among lawmakers and industry experts. "This proposal could significantly impact the growing EV market," said one industry analyst. "It remains to be seen how consumers and manufacturers will react."

Two hearings related to the Stop EV Freeloading Act have been held by the Senate Finance Committee. The first was titled **"HOUSE REPUBLICAN SUPPLEMENTAL IRS FUNDING CUTS: ANALYZING THE IMPACT ON FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE FEDERAL DEFICIT."** While this hearing did not directly address EV taxes, it set a precedent for committee oversight and potential future discussions.

No amendments have been proposed for S.2882 as of the latest available information. The bill was sponsored by Senator Deb Fischer [R-NE] and has been referred to the Finance Committee. It currently has three cosponsors, all of whom are members of that committee.

Since no roll call votes have taken place on this bill, it is unclear whether it will be a party-line vote or a bipartisan effort. "The outcome of any potential vote would depend heavily on how both sides view the fairness and necessity of these new taxes," said a congressional aide familiar with the bill's progress.

As the Stop EV Freeloading Act moves through the legislative process, stakeholders from various industries will closely monitor its development. The bill could have far-reaching implications for electric vehicle owners, manufacturers, and the broader transportation sector. For now, it remains to be seen whether this proposal will gain enough support to become law.

In conclusion, while the Stop EV Freeloading Act is still in its early stages, it has already generated significant interest and debate. As the bill progresses through committee hearings and potentially a full vote, all eyes will be on how it navigates the complex landscape of U.S. transportation policy.
