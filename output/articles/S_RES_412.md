**United Auto Workers Negotiations: Senate Resolution 412 Aims to Support Workers**

In the ongoing negotiations between the United Auto Workers (UAW) and the "Big Three" automakers—General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford—Senator Bernie Sanders has introduced a resolution aimed at supporting these workers. [S.Res.412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/412), sponsored by Senator Bernard Sanders from Vermont, expresses support for the nearly 150,000 UAW members currently engaged in negotiations with their employers.

The resolution not only backs workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain but also calls on the automakers to negotiate in good faith. It emphasizes the importance of offering fair contracts that reflect the hard work and dedication of these employees. While the bill is still at an early stage, it has already garnered significant support from 33 cosponsors across both parties.
