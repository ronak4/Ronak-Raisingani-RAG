**United Auto Workers Get Support in Negotiations with Big Three Automakers**

In an effort to support the nearly 150,000 United Auto Workers (UAW) members currently negotiating collective bargaining agreements with General Motors, Stellantis, and Ford—known as the "Big Three" automakers—a new resolution has been introduced. [S.Res.412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/412), sponsored by Senator Bernard Sanders from Vermont ([Sen. Sanders, Bernard [I-VT]](https://www.congress.gov/member/S000033)), aims to bolster workers' rights and ensure fair negotiations.

The resolution, currently in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, expresses support for UAW members as they seek better working conditions and wages. It calls on the automakers to negotiate in good faith and offers a fair contract to their employees. This move comes at a critical time when workers are facing significant challenges due to ongoing negotiations.

The bill has garnered 33 cosponsors from both parties, including Senators Brown, Baldwin, Warren, and Fetterman. Notably, all of these cosponsors are members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, ensuring that the resolution will receive thorough consideration within the committee.

So far, no hearings have been held on S.Res.412. The bill was introduced to support UAW members but has not yet reached a stage where it can be discussed in detail by lawmakers. For the most up-to-date information, you can visit the official [Congress.gov page for S.Res.412](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-resolution/412).

No amendments have been proposed for this bill as of now. The resolution stands on its own, with no changes or additions suggested by other lawmakers. This means that the current wording and intent of the bill remain intact.

Since there are no recorded roll call votes, it is not possible to determine if any vote was a party-line vote or bipartisan one at this time. However, given Senator Sanders' history of supporting workers’ rights and his cosponsors from both parties, it's likely that the resolution will receive broad support when it does come up for consideration.

The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee plays a crucial role in shaping labor laws and policies. By being referred to this committee, S.Res.412 is taking an important step towards becoming law. The committee has the power to hold hearings, make recommendations, and ultimately decide whether or not the resolution should move forward.

In conclusion, while S.Res.412 remains in early stages of the legislative process, it represents a significant show of support for UAW members during critical negotiations with major automakers. With bipartisan backing and no amendments proposed so far, the bill is well-positioned to gain momentum as it moves through Congress. For those concerned about workers' rights and fair labor practices, this resolution offers hope that progress can be made in improving conditions for millions of American workers.
