**Title: Key Bill Aims to Secure Funding for 9/11 Memorial and Museum**

In the wake of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, the National September 11 Memorial & Museum has become a symbol of resilience and remembrance. Now, Representative Anthony D'Esposito from New York's 4th congressional district is leading efforts to ensure its continued operation through the [9/11 Memorial and Museum Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/hr/5401). This bill, introduced on [bill introduction date], directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to award a one-time grant to the nonprofit organization that operates the memorial and museum. The funds will be used exclusively for operation, security, and maintenance.

The act is currently before the [Natural Resources Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json), which has jurisdiction over natural resources, public lands, and other matters related to the memorial's location in New York City. The committee plays a crucial role in shaping legislation that affects the city and its landmarks.

Rep. D'Esposito is not acting alone; 41 cosponsors from both parties have joined him in supporting this important piece of legislation. Among them are Reps. Carter, Troy [D-LA-2] (D-LA) and Clarke, Yvette D. [D-NY-9](https://api.congress.gov/v3/member/C001125?format=json), who have shown bipartisan support for the bill.

The nonprofit organization operating the memorial must provide free admission to all facilities and museums associated with the National September 11 Memorial & Museum as a condition of receiving the grant. This commitment ensures that the site remains accessible to the public, fostering education and reflection on the events of 9/11.

While no direct hearings have been held on H.R. 5401, five related hearings were conducted by the House Public Lands Committee in 2024. These hearings focused on various aspects of natural resources and public lands, including issues that may indirectly impact the memorial's operations. However, none specifically addressed this bill.

As of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.R. 5401. The absence of amendments suggests a straightforward process so far, but it is not uncommon for bills to undergo changes before reaching the floor for a vote.

No votes have been recorded on H.R. 5401 as of the latest data from Congress.gov. This means that the bill has not yet reached the stage where members can cast their ballots. The outcome remains uncertain until the committee takes action and sends it to the full House for consideration.

The [Natural Resources Committee](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json) will play a pivotal role in determining the fate of this bill. If passed, H.R. 5401 would secure vital funding for the ongoing operation and maintenance of one of America's most significant memorials.

For those concerned about the future of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, it is crucial to monitor the progress of this bill. The support from both sides of the aisle indicates a shared commitment to preserving this important site. However, with no direct hearings or votes yet, there is still time for further discussion and potential amendments.

In conclusion, H.R. 5401 - the 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act - stands as a testament to the ongoing effort to honor those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. Its journey through Congress will be watched closely by many, ensuring that this memorial remains a place of reflection and remembrance for generations to come.
