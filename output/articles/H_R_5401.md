**A Step Forward in Honoring 9/11: The Journey of H.R.5401**

In the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the nation sought ways to honor and remember those who lost their lives. Now, nearly two decades later, a new bill seeks to ensure that memory endures through the establishment of a memorial and museum dedicated to the victims. The 9/11 Memorial and Museum Act (H.R.5401) was introduced by Rep. Anthony D'Esposito [R-NY-4] on Congress.gov.

The bill aims to create a lasting tribute to those who perished in the attacks, providing a place where visitors can learn about the events of that day and the heroes who responded. It authorizes funding for the construction, operation, and maintenance of these memorials and museums, ensuring they remain accessible to future generations.

Currently, H.R.5401 is before the Natural Resources Committee, which handles legislation related to public lands, national parks, and other environmental issues. This committee plays a crucial role in determining whether the bill moves forward or faces delays. As of now, it has 20 cosponsors from both parties, indicating broad support for the initiative.

Rep. D'Esposito [R-NY-4] is the primary sponsor of H.R.5401. His introduction of this legislation underscores his commitment to preserving the memory of those who lost their lives on that fateful day and ensuring that future generations understand the significance of 9/11.

While the bill has gained traction with its sponsors, it remains in an early stage of the legislative process. No hearings have been held yet, nor have any amendments been proposed. This means that the Natural Resources Committee will need to take action before the bill can move forward. The committee’s next steps could include scheduling a hearing or voting on whether to advance the legislation.

Interestingly, none of the cosponsors serve on the Natural Resources Committee. This could potentially slow down the process if there is no direct oversight from members who are familiar with the bill's content and goals. However, the broad support among lawmakers suggests that the committee may still find a way to move the bill forward.

As for amendments, H.R.5401 has not yet seen any proposed changes. This means that the original version of the legislation remains intact as it moves through the legislative process. Any future amendments would need to be carefully crafted and debated by lawmakers before they can be added to the bill.

Currently, there have been no votes on H.R.5401. The bill is still in the referral stage, meaning that it has not yet reached a full House vote. Given its current status as "N/A" (Not Applicable), it indicates that the bill has not advanced far enough to warrant voting.

The journey of H.R.5401 from introduction to enactment will be crucial for ensuring that the memory of 9/11 remains alive and relevant. As the bill moves through its early stages, supporters hope that it will gain momentum and eventually become law. The establishment of a memorial and museum dedicated to the victims would serve as a powerful reminder of the resilience and unity that emerged in the aftermath of one of history’s darkest days.
