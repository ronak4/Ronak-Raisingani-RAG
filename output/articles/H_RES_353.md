**Raising Awareness: The Push for May 5 as National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls**

In the ongoing fight to address the alarming rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls (MMIWG), a new resolution is gaining momentum in Congress. House Resolution 353, introduced by Republican Representative Dan Newhouse from Washington’s 4th district, seeks to designate May 5, 2023, as the “National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.” This resolution aims to raise public awareness about this critical issue without proposing any new laws or funding.

The bill is currently in two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Judiciary Committee. These committees play crucial roles in shaping legislation that affects Native American communities, making their involvement essential for the resolution’s success.

Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington’s 4th district, introduced H.Res.353 on March 29, 2023. As of now, the bill has gained support from 39 cosponsors, including Democrats and Republicans. This bipartisan backing reflects the urgency and importance of addressing MMIWG.

The resolution is part of a broader effort to bring attention to this issue. Rep. Newhouse’s initiative aligns with ongoing discussions in Congress about the need for more comprehensive policies to protect Indigenous women and girls. By designating May 5 as a national day of awareness, the resolution hopes to galvanize communities, organizations, and policymakers to take action.

While no specific hearings have been held on H.Res.353, it is important to note that related bills and committee meetings often address similar issues. For instance, the Natural Resources Committee has held several hearings on environmental justice and tribal rights, which are closely tied to the broader context of MMIWG. Similarly, the Judiciary Committee’s oversight hearings have delved into various aspects of criminal justice reform, including protections for vulnerable populations.

As of now, no amendments have been proposed for H.Res.353. The bill remains in its initial stages, with the primary focus on raising awareness and building support among lawmakers. However, the lack of amendments does not diminish the importance of this resolution. It serves as a powerful statement of intent from Congress to address MMIWG.

No votes have been recorded for H.Res.353 yet. Given the bipartisan nature of its cosponsors, it is likely that any vote would be closely watched by advocates and policymakers alike. A party-line vote could indicate a more contentious debate, while a bipartisan vote might signal broader support and a higher likelihood of success.

In conclusion, House Resolution 353 represents an important step in raising awareness about the critical issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. While it does not propose new laws or funding, its potential to galvanize action and build momentum for future legislation makes it a significant piece of proposed policy. As Congress continues to deliberate on this resolution, the hope is that it will contribute to a broader conversation about how to protect and support Native American communities.
