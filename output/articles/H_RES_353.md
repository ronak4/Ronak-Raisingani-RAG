**Raising Awareness: Congressman Newhouse Proposes National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls**

In an effort to bring attention to the critical issue of missing and murdered indigenous women and girls, Washington’s 4th district representative, Dan Newhouse (R-WA), has introduced a resolution that seeks to designate May 5, 2023, as the “National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls.” [H.Res.353](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-resolution/353) is currently in the early stages of the legislative process.

The resolution aims to raise public awareness about the alarming rates of violence against indigenous women and girls, which have been persistently underreported and understudied. [Rep. Dan Newhouse](https://www.congress.gov/member/N000189), a Republican representative from Washington’s 4th district, introduced H.Res.353 to ensure that this issue receives the attention it deserves.

The bill is currently referred to two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Judiciary Committee. [Natural Resources Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/natural-resources-committee/house) focuses on issues related to natural resources, public lands, and water, while the Judiciary Committee handles matters of justice, civil rights, and legal reform.

As of now, 39 cosponsors have joined Newhouse in supporting this resolution. Among them are representatives such as Gwen Moore (D-WI-4), Doris O. Matsui (D-CA-7), Katie Porter (D-CA-47), and Eleanor Holmes Norton (Del.), a long-time advocate for indigenous rights. Notably, several of these cosponsors also sit on the Natural Resources Committee, which could expedite the bill’s progress.

No specific hearings have been held on H.Res.353 as of now. However, it is worth noting that related bills and topics have had hearings in Congress. For instance, [H.R. 6441](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6441), which addresses violence against women, has undergone scrutiny by the Judiciary Committee.

Since H.Res.353 is a resolution and not a bill that proposes new laws or funding, no amendments have been proposed for this particular resolution. The focus remains on raising awareness rather than implementing specific policies.

As of now, there are no recorded votes on H.Res.353. Given the bipartisan nature of its sponsors and cosponsors, it is likely that any vote would be a bipartisan effort. However, without a recorded vote, we cannot determine if this will be the case.

The introduction of H.Res.353 by Rep. Newhouse marks an important step in addressing the urgent need to recognize and honor the lives lost to violence while also advocating for better support systems for indigenous communities. The resolution aims to create a day dedicated to remembering those who have gone missing or been murdered, as well as to push for more comprehensive data collection and policy changes.

While H.Res.353 is currently in the early stages of the legislative process, its potential impact on raising awareness and fostering dialogue around this critical issue cannot be understated. As it moves through the committees and potentially receives a vote, it will be crucial to monitor its progress and support from both sides of the aisle.

In conclusion, H.Res.353 is an important step towards recognizing the ongoing struggle faced by indigenous women and girls. While there are no immediate concerns about the bill’s passage, continued attention and support are necessary to ensure that this issue receives the national recognition it deserves.
