**Energy Bill H.R. 1: A Comprehensive Plan to Lower Costs and Boost Development**

In the ongoing debate over energy policy, House Republicans are pushing forward with [H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1), a sweeping bill aimed at reducing energy costs and boosting domestic production of oil, gas, and minerals. The legislation has been referred to multiple committees for consideration, signaling its potential impact on the nation’s energy landscape.

The Lower Energy Costs Act seeks to expedite energy projects by eliminating or reducing certain fees related to the development of federal energy resources. It also aims to eliminate funds that provide incentives to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, a move that could be seen as controversial in an era where climate change is increasingly at the forefront of policy discussions.

The bill has been referred to two key committees: the [Natural Resources Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/natural-resources) and the [Energy and Commerce Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/energy-and-commerce). These committees will play a crucial role in shaping the final version of the legislation. Additionally, the bill has been referred to the [Transportation and Infrastructure Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/transportation-and-infrastructure), which could influence how energy projects impact transportation infrastructure.

The Lower Energy Costs Act is sponsored by Rep. Steve Scalise from Louisiana’s 1st congressional district. As a Republican, Scalise has been vocal about the need to reduce regulatory burdens on the energy sector and promote domestic production. With 49 cosponsors, including Reps. McMorris Rodgers (R-WA-5), Westerman (R-AR-4), and Graves (R-MO-6), the bill enjoys bipartisan support.

While the bill has not yet held any direct hearings, related hearings have taken place in various committees that may indirectly pertain to some aspects of H.R. 1. For instance, a hearing on [American Nuclear Energy Expansion: Updating Policies](https://www.congress.gov) and another on [MACRA Checkup: Assessing Implementation and Challenges](https://www.congress.gov) have provided context for the broader energy landscape.

Several amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act, with Amendment 168 by Rep. Graves (LA) being one of them. This amendment aims to provide regulatory certainty by explicitly authorizing common practices such as NPDES general permits and allowing for continuances during certain periods. These amendments reflect the ongoing debate within Congress over how best to balance environmental regulations with energy production.

Votes have occurred on H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act, with two roll call votes recorded. The bill passed by a vote of 225 to 204 (Roll no. 182), indicating that the vote was not strictly party-line but had some bipartisan support as there were more "Yea" votes than "Nay" votes.

In conclusion, [H.R. 1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1) is a significant piece of legislation that could have far-reaching implications for the energy sector. While it faces opposition from those concerned about climate change and environmental regulations, its passage would likely expedite energy projects and reduce costs for consumers. As the bill moves through committees and continues to gather support, it will be closely watched by stakeholders across the political spectrum.

For now, H.R. 1 remains in the early stages of the legislative process, but its potential impact on energy policy cannot be understated. Whether this bill becomes law or not, it is clear that the debate over energy costs and domestic production continues to shape the political landscape.
