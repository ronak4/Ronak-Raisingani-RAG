**Lower Energy Costs Act: A Comprehensive Plan to Boost U.S. Energy Sector**

In the ongoing debate over energy policy, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) has introduced H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, a sweeping bill aimed at reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of America’s energy sector. The bill was introduced on March 14, 2023, and is currently under consideration by multiple committees in Congress.

### What Does This Bill Do? Where Is It In The Process?

The Lower Energy Costs Act seeks to expedite the development, importation, and exportation of various energy resources such as oil, gas, and minerals. Key provisions include:

1. **Expediting Energy Projects**: The bill aims to streamline the approval process for energy projects by reducing bureaucratic hurdles.
2. **Eliminating or Reducing Fees**: It proposes eliminating or reducing certain fees related to the development of federal energy resources.
3. **Removing Incentives for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions**: The legislation seeks to eliminate funds that provide incentives for decreasing emissions of greenhouse gases.

As of now, H.R. 1 has been referred to both the Natural Resources Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee. No specific actions have been recorded on this bill yet, making its progress uncertain at present.

### What Committees Is This Bill In?

The Lower Energy Costs Act is currently under review by two key committees:

- **Natural Resources Committee**: [https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsii00?format=json)
- **Energy and Commerce Committee**: [https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00?format=json](https://api.congress.gov/v3/committee/house/hsif00?format=json)

These committees have jurisdiction over energy policy, making them the primary venues for debate and potential amendments.

### Who Is The Sponsor?

The bill was introduced by Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), a member of the House Republican leadership team known for his advocacy on infrastructure and energy issues. [Rep. Scalise](https://www.congress.gov/member/S001176) has been a vocal proponent of reducing regulatory burdens in the energy sector.

### Who Cosponsored This Bill? Are Any Of The Cosponsors On The Committee That The Bill Is In?

H.R. 1 has garnered support from 49 cosponsors, including Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Bruce Westerman (R-AR). Notably, both of these cosponsors are members of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which is one of the key committees reviewing this bill.

### Have Any Hearings Happened On The Bill? If So, What Were The Findings?

While no specific hearings have been held on H.R. 1 itself, related hearings have taken place in other committees. For instance:

- **American Nuclear Energy Expansion**: A hearing was held to discuss the expansion of nuclear energy and its role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
- **MACRA Checkup**: Another hearing focused on assessing the implementation and challenges of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA).

These hearings provide context for the broader issues surrounding energy policy but do not directly address H.R. 1.

### Have Any Amendments Been Proposed On The Bill? If So, Who Proposed Them And What Do They Do?

Several amendments have been proposed to H.R. 1:

- **Amendment 132 (Rules)**: This amendment was automatically adopted in the House and Committee of the Whole as per H. Res. 260.
- **Amendment 133**: Proposed by Rep. Donalds, this amendment requires a study on streamlining regulatory processes.

These amendments aim to further refine the bill’s provisions and address potential concerns raised during committee review.

### Have Any Votes Happened On The Bill? If So, Was It A Party-Line Vote Or A Bipartisan One?

Two roll call votes have occurred on H.R. 1:

- **Roll Call 182**: The bill passed by a vote of 225 to 204. This indicates that the vote was not strictly party-line; while there are significant numbers from both parties, it appears to have received support across party lines.

This bipartisan support suggests that the bill has broad appeal and could potentially pass with further amendments or refinements.

### Conclusion

The Lower Energy Costs Act is a multifaceted proposal aimed at boosting America’s energy sector by reducing costs and streamlining regulatory processes. With 49 cosponsors and support from key committees, it appears to have significant momentum. However, the bill's future remains uncertain until it completes its journey through Congress.

For those concerned about energy policy and its impact on the economy, H.R. 1 is a bill worth watching closely. Its passage could significantly alter how America approaches energy development and regulation in the coming years.
