**Lower Energy Costs Act: Aiming to Cut Bills but Stalled in Early Stages**

In the ongoing debate over energy costs, Congressman Steve Scalise (R-LA-1) has introduced H.R. 1, known as the Lower Energy Costs Act. This bill aims to reduce energy expenses for consumers by addressing various aspects of the energy market. However, as of now, there is no specific status update available on this bill from Congress.gov [H.R.1](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1).

The Lower Energy Costs Act was introduced by Representative Steve Scalise and has been referred to two key committees: the Natural Resources Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee. It currently has 20 cosponsors, indicating a level of bipartisan support among lawmakers [Congress.gov](https://www.congress.gov/member/S001176).

Both of these committees are crucial for the bill's progress. The Natural Resources Committee focuses on issues related to natural resources, water, and energy development, while the Energy and Commerce Committee handles matters concerning energy policy, telecommunications, and healthcare. Given that the bill is in its early stages, it’s not surprising that no hearings have been held yet [H.R.1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1).

Since no hearings have taken place, there are currently no findings to report on the bill's proposals. Hearings would typically involve discussions with experts, stakeholders, and other interested parties to gather information and opinions before the bill can move forward in the legislative process.

As for amendments, none have been proposed as of now [H.R.1 - Lower Energy Costs Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1/text). Amendments are introduced by members of Congress and can address various aspects of the bill, such as changing provisions or adding new sections to better align with policy goals.
