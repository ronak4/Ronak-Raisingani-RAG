**Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act: A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing the Crisis**

In an effort to combat one of America's most pressing social issues, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has introduced the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act (S.24)**. This bill aims to provide local and tribal governments with the resources needed to address homelessness through a comprehensive approach involving grants for planning and implementation.

The legislation requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award grants to eligible entities, which include local and tribal government bodies. These grants will support the development of programs that focus on both housing and services for homeless individuals and families. The bill also includes a provision for five-year implementation grants, allowing these entities to carry out activities and cover capital building costs associated with providing necessary accommodations.

Currently, the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act** is under consideration by the [Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee](https://www.congress.gov/committee/health-education-labor-and-pensions).
