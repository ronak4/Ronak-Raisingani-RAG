**Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act: A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing the Crisis**

In an effort to combat one of America's most pressing social issues, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) has introduced the **Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act (S.24)**. This bill aims to provide much-needed support for local and tribal governments by awarding grants that will help them plan and implement programs aimed at addressing homelessness.

The legislation requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to allocate funds to these entities, enabling them to carry out a variety of activities related to housing and services for homeless individuals and families. A key feature is the provision of five-year implementation grants, which will assist in covering both capital building costs and ongoing operational expenses.
