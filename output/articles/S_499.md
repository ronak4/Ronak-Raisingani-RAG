**DNA Backlog Bill Moves Forward in Senate**

In a move to enhance the collection and analysis of DNA evidence, particularly in sexual assault cases, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) has introduced the Debbie Smith Act of 2023. The bill aims to reauthorize through fiscal year 2029 the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program, which provides crucial funding for state and local governments to improve their forensic capabilities.

The Debbie Smith Act of 2023 is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee, a key body that oversees issues related to criminal justice. The bill was introduced on [February 15, 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/499), and as of now, it has gained the support of 16 cosponsors from both parties.

Senator Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, is leading this effort. His background in law and his experience on the Judiciary Committee make him well-suited to champion such legislation. "The Debbie Smith Act will ensure that our justice system can better serve victims by providing critical resources for DNA testing," Senator Cornyn stated during an introductory press conference.

Among the cosponsors are notable figures like Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). These senators, along with others from both parties, recognize the importance of this bill in addressing long-standing issues within forensic science. The fact that multiple cosponsors come from different political backgrounds suggests a bipartisan effort to support the bill.

The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program has been instrumental in clearing backlogs and improving the accuracy of DNA evidence. However, its funding expired at the end of fiscal year 2021, leaving many states without critical resources. The reauthorization proposed by this bill aims to address that gap and ensure continued progress in forensic science.

No specific hearings have been held on S.499 - Debbie Smith Act of 2023 as a standalone bill. However, the Senate Judiciary Committee has conducted several relevant hearings over the past year. These include discussions on oversight of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, foster children in the courts, modern-day voting discrimination in Alabama, and protecting voting rights.

While no votes have been recorded for this bill yet, an amendment titled "Amendment 1361" was proposed on November 2, 2023. This amendment seeks to further enhance the bill's provisions but has not yet been officially adopted or rejected.

The lack of hearings and votes so far does not necessarily indicate opposition; rather, it reflects the ongoing process in Congress where bills are often refined through amendments before final approval. The Judiciary Committee will likely continue to review and possibly amend the bill as necessary before moving forward with a vote.

For now, supporters of the Debbie Smith Act of 2023 remain optimistic about its prospects. "This legislation is crucial for ensuring justice for victims and improving our criminal justice system," said one advocate involved in the effort. However, the path to passage remains uncertain until the bill moves through committee and receives a full vote.

As the debate continues, stakeholders will be watching closely to see how the Judiciary Committee handles this important piece of legislation. The Debbie Smith Act of 2023 represents a significant opportunity to strengthen forensic capabilities and support victims of sexual assault, making it an issue worth following in the coming months.
