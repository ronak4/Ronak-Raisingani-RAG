The Debbie Smith Act of 2023, introduced on February 16, 2023, by Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), aims to reauthorize the Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program through fiscal year 2029. This bill seeks to enhance and expand the collection and analysis of DNA evidence, particularly in sexual assault cases, providing crucial financial support to state and local governments.

The bill has made significant progress within the Senate Judiciary Committee. On November 2, 2023, it passed with an amendment by a voice vote after being discharged from the committee by unanimous consent. The Debbie Smith Act of 2023 then moved to the House of Representatives on November 6, 2023. It has seen no further action in the House as of November 2025.

Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) has taken a leading role in this legislation. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, he understands the importance of improving DNA evidence collection and analysis to solve crimes more effectively. The bill has garnered 16 cosponsors, including prominent figures such as Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). Notably, several cosponsors are also members of the Judiciary Committee, indicating strong bipartisan support for the bill.

The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program has been instrumental in addressing the backlog of untested sexual assault kits across the country. By reauthorizing this program, the bill aims to ensure that state and local governments can continue to receive vital funding to improve their forensic capabilities. This is particularly crucial given the increasing recognition of the importance of DNA evidence in solving crimes.

The Judiciary Committee plays a critical role in the bill's journey through Congress. As the primary committee responsible for matters related to justice, civil rights, and law enforcement, it has the authority to hold hearings, consider amendments, and ultimately decide whether to send the bill to the full Senate or House for a vote. While no specific hearings have been mentioned, the strong bipartisan support among cosponsors suggests that the committee is likely to move the bill forward.
