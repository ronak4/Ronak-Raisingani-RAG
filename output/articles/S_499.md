**DNA Backlog Bill Moves Forward in Senate**

In a significant step towards improving the nation’s forensic DNA capabilities, Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) has introduced the Debbie Smith Act of 2023.

This committee plays a critical role in overseeing federal laws related to criminal justice and civil rights, making it well-suited for this bill’s focus on forensic science.

Senator Cornyn has championed this cause, recognizing the importance of robust DNA evidence in solving crimes and bringing justice to victims. “The Debbie Smith Act is essential for ensuring that our law enforcement agencies have the tools they need to solve cases,” said Senator Cornyn [C001056](https://www.congress.gov/member/C001056).

The bill has garnered support from 16 cosponsors, including Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN).
